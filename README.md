## About Me
I am a new developer residing in the St. Louis area. I recently went through LaunchCode's LC101 program and look forward to further building my skills and knowledge base as I continue my journey into the tech field.

## What I've learned
While in LC101, my learning was centered around the languages of **JavaScript** and **Java**. While learning those languages, the curriculum introduced me to many other tools, frameworks and databases used in the employment of those languages.

### These technologies included:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* TypeScript
* Spring
* Hibernate/JPA
* Bootstrap
* Node.js
* Angular
* MySQL
* Thymeleaf
* GitHub

## What I'm Learning
Currently, in addition to working through LaunchCode's Liftoff program, I am familiarizing myself with new languages and technologies.

### Currently exploring:
* Python
* React
* OAuth 2.0

## My Goals:
I’m looking forward to working with talented individuals and building my knowledge base in this exciting world of tech. Of course, this would include finding a career where I can grow, learn, contribute and make a difference.
